# Contributing to our page
First of all, thanks for having an interest in contributing. The Pseudo Dopamine Centre takes pride in the contributions we receive from other enthusiasts.

As this is our community page, We are looking to do most of the major designs ourselves, however we are open to small contributions. These contributions are:
- Issue submissions (Bug reports, potential feature requests, etc...)
- Hot-fixes

## Submitting an issue
If you notice a bug, or you have an idea for a potential feature, the best way you can communicate it to us is to submit an issue (Provided it doesn't exist already).

If you've spotted a bug:
- Please title your issue with the prefix of "**BUG REPORT:** ", leading on with the bug at hand.
- For your description, please dive into further detail of what happened. You can include links to images or any console outputs if you can obtain them. If you can replicate the bug, please document the steps you took so it's easy to track down.

If you want to request a feature:
- Please title your issue with the prefix of "**FEATURE REQUEST:** ", leading on with the feature you'd like to see.
- For your description, please dive into further detail of what you'd like to see on the website. Feel free to include any images which help to visualise your idea.
- **Please note:** Not all features will fit the preferences of what we'd like the site to look like. If your feature is rejected, this is most likely the reason. If there are any reasons otherwise, we'll be sure to leave a comment explaining why.

## Writing a hot-fix
If you'd like to take on a bug that we've missed or haven't responded to as yet, here's what you'll need to do:
1. Leave a comment on the issue expressing your interest.
2. Once a maintainer acknowledges it and is happy with letting you take it on, fork the repository and commit your fixes to the "Hot-fix" branch.
3. Once your changes have been made, create a pull request into the origin's master branch and title your request as "HOT-FIX: ", leading on with the bug you're tackling. Add "Ramone Graham (Sweetboy13735)" as a reviewer of the changes.
4. I'll (Sweetboy) have a look and review the changes. If I approve of them, I'll merge the changes into master. If the request still requires more changes, Please take a look and amend to them. I'll review again and approve once everything's up to standard.
